## Hi there 👋

My name is Juan Zurita 🇧🇴 🇪🇸! I am a Computer Science Student at BYU-Idaho and I love learning about technology in general 🖥️.

I have been coding in **python** since I was in High School. After a voluntary service mission in Bolivia, I enrolled in BYU-Idaho where I learned a lot more about Web Design and Development🖼️ , Object Oriented Programming🐈, Data Analysis📊 and Machine Learning🤖.

I am passionate about creating any type of software which has influence in the world and learning as much as I can. I am pursuing a certificate in Machine Learnging but have been working on front-end development as a hobby.
